To play with statistical tests use [Sandbox.ipynb](./notebooks/Sandbox.ipynb) notebook. You can change the following data generation parameters:
```python
success_rate = 0.02
uplift = 0.2
N = 5000 # Number of users in groups
NN = 2000 # Number of runs

beta = 1000
skew = 1
```
Read the article for the details.
